<h1>About</h1>
<div>
    The Baseball Stat Predictor is an app that predicts hitting and pitching stats for any player in the MLB.
    The Baseball Stat Predictor also has a mode where any baseball player can manually enter in their past game
    stats and the Baseball Stat Predictor will predict their next game stats. There are 2 competition modes, one where
    users can predict the outcomes of future MLB matchups and another that allows users to predict game stats for any
    player in the MLB.
